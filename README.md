# Low-Power-MAC-Unit-PPA
Designed and implemented three distinct pipelined Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) units, including a novel data-aware clock-gated architecture optimized for sparse workloads.
Conducted a comprehensive Power, Performance, and Area (PPA) analysis on a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC to quantify the trade-offs of low-power design techniques.
Discovered that I/O power constituted 95% of total dynamic power, revealing that core-level clock gating yielded negligible system-level power savings for this design and highlighting the importance of a full-system power profile.

### Technologies Used:
Verilog, Xilinx Vivado, FPGAs, Low-Power Design, PPA Analysis
