# Low-Power-MAC-Unit-PPA
Designed three pipelined MAC units (including a novel clock-gated architecture) and conducted PPA analysis on a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC to quantify low-power design trade-offs. Revealed I/O power was 95% of the total, proving core-level clock gating ineffective for overall system power reduction and requiring a full-system power analysis.
